# Horseshoe-Bayesian-Quantile-Regression

Matlab and R implimentations of the horseshoe prior Bayesian quantile regression model in Kohns & Szendrei (2020). If you use the code in your work please cite as:

The important codes are in the root directory, and the "functions" directory
*  HSBQR.m is the main function that you will need if you'd like to use the method.
*  MC_example.m shows how to setup the Monte-Carlo experiments done in the paper, and run the HSBQR on one of experiments (This code uses the files in the MC directory too)
